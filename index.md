Welcome to pHashCoding!

This blog is intended to serve as a place to put things I have been working on.
Mostly things related to perceptual hashing along with various other projects.
Additionally, I hope these notes prove useful to somebody and perhaps lead to some
useful discussion and feedback.  

Perceptual Hashing encompasses techniques that involve extracting a concise
descriptor of a source signal which can come in any number of multimedia
formats - e.g. audio, video, text, etc.  It is much like a crypotographic hash
(for instance, an md5 checksum), but with an important distinction.  Whereas a cryptographic hash affords
little robustness with respect to deviations in the signal (i.e. a small change
in the signal will yield a big change in the computed checksum), a perceptual hash
will preserve a smaller distance between perceptually similar hashes and a greater
distance between hashes computed from arbitrary sources.

I hope these notes prove useful to someone.
Suggestions and comments are welcome.
